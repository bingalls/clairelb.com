        <p class="mb-4 text-center">Claire was raised in Hart County Georgia, in the country with her two parents and 7 siblings. She had great exposure to historic homes and antiques throughout her childhood, because of her grandparents and her mother, who collected old furniture, china, antiques and more from yard sales and estate sales in the area. All this influenced Claire to apply for Interior Design at Athens Technical College. Throughout her school experience, she has completed 4 years of classes in a 2-year program.</p>

        <p class="mb-2 text-center">“I want to make a difference through charity and mission work. I would like to be able to build houses for those in need of shelter and more. I would like for my designs to affect many people and inspire them with texture, smell, touch, color, and sound.”</p>
