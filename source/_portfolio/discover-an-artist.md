This assignment's requirements were to create a series of two digital presentation boards about an artist that we discover through in-person and online research and the environment designed to feature the art. We needed to provide and connect our research to the interior design field by framing the artists and the artwork selection in a residential space. Claire chose Hannah Betzel as her artist. The fictitious client profile created was of Aurora Lane. Provided to flush out the design was: textiles, lighting, flooring, a color palette for the environment created, and a sketch up model.
