White Pines is an ongoing mixed-use project, not only creating a fun and wonderful environment for all ages, but also creating a convenient and functional environment. This condo design is designed to be an all age friendly space. 8 x 8 Designs have made it their goal to make this condo accessible to all ages. Every room is designed to have a 5' turn around and other ADA requirements. This is a fictional project used to give experience to the Athens Technical College students in mixed-use developments.
